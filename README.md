# Covid-19-Statistical-Analysis
In this project, I carried out a statistical analysis of daily cases of COVID-19 in the country of Russia. During this project, I made a data extraction from the website "https://www.worldometers.info/", in such a way that I modeled a statistical representation of time series where we compared the waves of contagion with respect to the dates of the pandemic.
